# TI-99
Programs and other info for the TI-99/4A

My first computer (as a teenager) was a TI-99/4A.  I learned how
to program in BASIC and assembly language on the TI, and have fond
memories of learning and tinkering during the dawn of home computers.
This eventually led to a long and rewarding career in the computer
industry.

This is a collection of old programs I wrote as a kid that I deemed
worth sharing.  The collection will grow as I find time to sift through
the many files I have transferred from numerous disorganized floppy
disks.

Probably the most interesting project is the Asteroids game, written
in assembly language.  I hope some TI fans out there will enjoy it!
